# pz-metrics-analysis
## Dashboard
The dashboard is a node tool used to view and edit components of pre-made Kibana graphs. Graph data is stored in the [graph_data.json](graph_data.json) file, and Kibana queries are edited using string templating.


## Data
The data section includes analysis about runtimes of asynchronous vs. synchronous logging in [pz-workflow](https://github.com/venicegeo/pz-workflow).


## Scripts
The scripts section holds elastic search queries for the Kibana graphs shown in Dashboard. This allows the same data to be accessed through the terminal in JSON format.
