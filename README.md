# Pz-Metrics
## Dashboard
The dashboard is a node tool used to view and edit components of pre-made Kibana graphs, as well as track Elasticsearch logs. Graph data and log queries are stored in the [data.json](/config/data.json) file.


## Queries
The queries section holds elasticsearch queries and kibana links for the graphs and logs shown in Dashboard. This allows for use of the same queries outside the Dashboard.
